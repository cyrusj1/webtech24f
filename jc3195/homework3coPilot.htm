    <h3> Homework 3</h3>
    <p id="desc">
      The form given below has 3 fields. Let us assume that the user will type in
      the name of one of 3 products: Milk, Apple, or Fish. The user may enter these 
      using any mix of cases, so be aware. You need to check to ensure that the user
      enters a value. If it is not one of these 3, let the user know. 
      Then the user will enter a quantity. You need to check to ensure that a quantity is entered 
      (you may assume that 0 is a valid quality) and that the value is numeric. 
      Once validated, use the following costs - 1 bottle of milk is $3.50; one 
      apple is $0.99 and one pound of fish is $5.99 - and show the amount owed
      in the third field. All of this should be done when the appropriate 
      button is pressed. The amount must be shown with 2 decimal places and prefixed with
      a $ (dollar) sign.     
    </p>

	<p>1: My first question in Copilot was just copying and pasting all the code I had. I gave me back a completed string of code but I dont need all the code just the parts I dont already have.</p>
 <p> 2: My first attempt didnt work so i coppied the code and put it back into Copilot and asked why it isnt working</p>
 <p> 3: same problem the code isnt working. The total cost just wont appear.</p>
 <P> 4: Now I got it to work, I deleted all my code and readded all of there code rather than just the script</P>
 <p>5: overall I thought this was more annoying then writing the code. Any problem I ran into made it hard because I didnt know what was going on and what to fix.</p>
