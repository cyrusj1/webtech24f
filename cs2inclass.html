<h2> All About Cyrus </h2>




<p>  
Hello, I am Cyrus Jewett. I am in my senior year at Babson College. I am from Duxbury, Ma which is located in 
between Boston and Cape Cod. I decided to come to Babson because I knew I wanted to major in business and wanted
to stay close to home. I also lived in London for 2 years when i was in kindergarten and first grade.
In middle school and highschool I worked as a deckhand on commercial Striped Bass and Bluefin Tuna boats.
Along as also working in a Bait shop and building custom fishing poles. This turned fishing into a massive hobby of mine. 
I described it often as the most prudcutive way to be unproductive. From Tuna fishing alot Ive caught big fish, largest being 650lbs. Along as getting hit by a humpback whale, and catching a great white shark. In 2023 I interned at PwC in Audit 
in Boston. In 2024 I interned in the Roche Group in Diagnostics, located in Indianapolis working for Corporate Accounts.

<h2>My future interests</h2>
<p>
    In the future I really hope to work in the healthcare industry. Specifically in the Venture Capital side of the Healthcare industry. Healthcare interests me because I had prior health scares which really gave me an appreciation for the Industry. Then the venture Capital side sounds really interesting just because of the contant and massive innovation helping people live longer and better lives.
